#LAB: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with Deployment Manager and Cloud Monitoring

#Objectives
#Create a Deployment Manager deployment.

#Update a Deployment Manager deployment.

#View the load on a VM instance using Cloud Monitoring


##Task 1: Sign in to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console

##Task 2: Confirm that needed APIs are enabled

#3.	Scroll down in the list of enabled APIs, and confirm that these APIs are enabled:

# Cloud Deployment Manager v2 API, Cloud Runtime Configuration API, Cloud Monitoring API


gcloud services list [--available     | --enabled] [--filter="Cloud Deployment Manager v2 Cloud Runtime Configuration, Cloud Monitoring] 

##Task 3: Create a Deployment Manager deployment

To place the zone that Qwiklabs assigned you to into an environment variable called MY_ZONE:

export MY_ZONE=us-central1-a
 
#At the Cloud Shell prompt, download an editable Deployment Manager template:
gsutil cp gs://cloud-training/gcpfcoreinfra/mydeploy.yaml mydeploy.yaml

#n the Cloud Shell, use the sed command to replace the PROJECT_ID placeholder string with your Google Cloud Platform project ID using this command:
sed -i -e "s/PROJECT_ID/$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/" mydeploy.yaml

#n the Cloud Shell, use the sed command to replace the ZONE placeholder string with your Google Cloud Platform zone using this command:
sed -i -e "s/ZONE/$MY_ZONE/" mydeploy.yaml

#View the mydeploy.yaml file, with your modifications, with this command:
cat mydeploy.yaml

#Build a deployment from the template:

gcloud deployment-manager deployments create my-first-depl --config mydeploy.yaml

##Task 4: Update a Deployment Manager deployment

# Launch the nano text editor to edit the mydeploy.yaml file:

nano mydeploy.yaml

#Find the line that sets the value of the startup script, value: "apt-get update", and edit it so that it looks like this:

      value: "apt-get update; apt-get install nginx-light -y"
	  
	  
	  
#Enter this command to cause Deployment Manager to update your deployment to install the new startup script:

gcloud deployment-manager deployments update my-first-depl --config mydeploy.yaml


#Confirm that the deployment was successful. In the GCP Console, on the Navigation menu (Navigation menu), click Compute Engine > VM instances. 
#You will see that a VM instance called my-vm has been created, as specified by the template.

gcloud deployment-manager deployments describe my-first-depl

##Task 5: View the Load on a VM using Cloud Monitoring

#In the GCP Console, on the Navigation menu (Navigation menu), click Compute Engine > VM instances.

#To open a command prompt on the my-vm instance, click SSH in its row in the VM instances list.

#In the ssh session on my-vm, execute this command to create a CPU load:

dd if=/dev/urandom | gzip -9 >> /dev/null &

#Create a Monitoring workspace

#In the ssh session on my-vm, execute this command to create a CPU load:

dd if=/dev/urandom | gzip -9 >> /dev/null &

#Terminate your workload generator. Return to your ssh session on my-vm and enter this command:

kill %1
